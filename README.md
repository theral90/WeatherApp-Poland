# WeatherApp_Flask
# Weather App using Flask, Open Weather Map API 

Weather checking app using the Flask framework.

What do I need first?

Nothing much, just Python 3+ and (ideally) virtualenv.

How do I start it?

Clone the repo, cd to the repo directory then run (again, ideally inside a virtualenv):

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python3 main.py

Assuming you're using the default templates and not rolling your own, go to localhost:5000/ and check weather in biggest cities in Poland.
